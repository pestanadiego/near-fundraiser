# Fundnear

## Overview
Fundnear is a NEAR dApp made to allow everyone to create fundraisers and donate to good causes. Donating is not the only way to help, everybody can also upvote those fundraisers that deserve recognition to positioning them first on the main page.

Key points to have in mind:
- Every donation counts as an upvote, but not every upvote counts as a donation.
- There are only upvotes, not downvotes.
- A fundraiser cannot have multiple upvotes made by the same wallet.
